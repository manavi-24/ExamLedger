## 📌 Introduction

This project aims to eliminate security issues, manipulation, and central authority in online examination systems by leveraging **blockchain technology**. The system ensures:

- Tamper-proof question & answer storage
- Fair evaluation and transparent results
- Immutable logs of all exam-related actions

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

In recent times, major examination systems have suffered from issues like paper leaks and manipulated result data. Our **blockchain-based exam portal** provides:

- ✅ **Decentralization** — IPFS for question/answer storage  
- ✅ **Transparency** — Immutable records on Ethereum  
- ✅ **Security** — Role-restricted smart contract logic  
- ✅ **Automation** — Streamlined exam lifecycle

---

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

### 📌 1. Exam Creation (Admin Role)
- Admin uploads questions as a JSON file to **IPFS**
- Receives a **CID (Content Identifier)**
- CID is stored in `ExamContract.sol` on **Ethereum**
- Students can **view**, not **edit**

### 📌 2. Student Submission (Student Role)
- Student answers questions offline
- Uploads answer JSON to **IPFS**
- CID is stored in `SubmissionContract.sol` on Ethereum

### 📌 3. Evaluation (Teacher/Admin Role)
- Teacher fetches answer using CID from IPFS
- Evaluates, uploads result to IPFS
- Stores result CID in `EvaluationContract.sol`

### 📌 4. Result Viewing (Student Role)
- Students fetch result CID from Ethereum
- View results and feedback from IPFS

|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Frontend             | React.js + Ethers.js                     |
| Backend              | Golang + Geth                            |
| Blockchain           | Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)              |
| Smart Contracts      | Solidity                                 |
| Storage              | IPFS                                     |
| Authentication       | MetaMask Wallet                          |

## 🧪 Example Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. ✅ **Admin** uploads exam (JSON) → IPFS → stores CID on Ethereum  
2. 🧑‍🎓 **Student** submits answers (JSON) → IPFS → stores CID on Ethereum  
3. 🧑‍🏫 **Teacher/Admin** fetches answers → evaluates → uploads evaluated JSON to IPFS → stores result CID  
4. 🔍 **Student** retrieves result CID → fetches score from IPFS → reads feedback

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js, npm
- Go installed
- MetaMask browser extension
- IPFS CLI installed
- Sepolia ETH in MetaMask

### 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-exam-system.git
cd blockchain-exam-system

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### ⚒️ Smart Contract Deployment

- Use Remix or Hardhat to deploy:
  - `ExamContract.sol`
  - `SubmissionContract.sol`
  - `EvaluationContract.sol`

- Add contract addresses to `.env` or config files
